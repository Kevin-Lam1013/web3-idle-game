## Web3 Idle Game
This game uses  smart wallets and embedded wallets.  It lets users log in with their email and makes transactions smooth without needing to worry about complicated web3 processes. I've learned how to put ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens into action, along with a staking contract. With this knowledge, I can create an idle game that operates on the blockchain, where players earn tokens by staking their NFTs.

### Set up
Make sure to have an `.env` file at the root of the project with the following structure :
